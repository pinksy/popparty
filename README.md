I made this for my daughter's 10th birthday party. It's a variation on the popular "four corners" children's party game...

1. Find posters of 4 different pop stars, pin them up in each corner of the room, and edit the 'pops' array accordingly
2. Fire up index.html in full screen mode. Project it onto a big screen if possible
3. Get all the kids to stand in the middle of the room
4. Play some music, and tell the kids to choose and stand in a corner
5. When the music stops, hit any key, and it will pause on a random popstar. Any kids in that corner are out
6. Repeat until there's a winner
